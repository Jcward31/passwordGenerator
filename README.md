# passwordGenerator

Password Protection is very important for keeping both buisness and personal information secure while on the web. Randomized passwords are much harder to crack than your standard passwords! This program will allow users to set specific criteria for the types of characters that the password should contain and then automaticlly generate based off of the choices that you have selected. These character options include lowercase, uppercase, numerical and special characters. The password length is also selected by the user but is required to be between 8 and 128 characters.
